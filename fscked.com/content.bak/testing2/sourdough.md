Important disclaimer: I am not an expert. This is just a document of what works for me. There is a lot of sourdough advice on the internet, and much of it will be better than mine.

I’m sorry this document is so long. I didn’t have time to write a shorter one.

I made this! You can too!



# Before we start: simpler no-knead recipes (updated 2020/03/31)

When I first started this document, the intention was to detail how I make sourdough. This process is optimised to produce the best bread I can, but uses some specialist equipment and requires some knowledge of bread-making techniques.

Since then, coronavirus has happened. If you want to use a sourdough starter to make bread as easily as you can, you should probably start with a no-knead recipe. This means you don’t need a stand mixer or to spend 10-15 minutes kneading by hand.

I’m trialling recipes as fast as I can and will keep updating this with notes and links.

## Tartine-style no-knead sourdough by thekitchn

https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-224367

This is the best no-knead I’ve tried yet. A few notes:

* The recipe is a slightly awkward size; half of it is a small-ish loaf. I’d suggest making 75%, which yields a 1 kg / 2 lb loaf:
    * 525 g bread flour
    * 395 g water
    *  110 g starter
    * 10.5 g salt
* I don’t like the volumetric (tablespoon) measurement for salt. A tablespoon of table salt and one of sea salt is a very different amount of salt. I made the recipe scaled to 50% (ie. I used 350 g of flour) and I used 7 g of salt (which is 1.8% - which is a good ratio of salt to flour.)
* You don’t need to stick strictly to the “fold every half hour” schedule but you do need to get plenty of folds in. With no kneading, the folding is what builds strength in the gluten network. The recipe suggests that each time you do four folds but I was doing quite a bit more, 8-10 or so. Wet hands are important here to stop the dough sticking to you!
* At least in my oven, the recipe as written would burn it. Where it said to do another 15-25 minutes at the end, I gave it barely ten and that was already too much. I’d suggest keeping a close eye on it at that stage and pulling it from the oven as soon as the crust is the colour you want.
* It develops a very robust crust, almost armour-plated. If you want to dial that back a bit, remove the pot lid earlier in the cooking process.

## Weekly sourdough bread by the Perfect Loaf

https://www.theperfectloaf.com/simple-weekday-sourdough-bread/

The directions on that page are very good and I won’t attempt to reproduce them here. However, the amounts in the recipe are a bit awkward (I think they’ve been converted from American units) and it makes a lot (two big loaves.) Here’s a modified recipe that will make one loaf and keeps the various ratios from the Perfect Loaf intact:

* 360 g white flour
* 90 g whole wheat flour
* 80 g bubbly levain
* 9 g salt
* 340 g water (add 315 g at first, then add the other 25 g later if the dough seems to need it.)

Other notes on this recipe:

* The timings in the recipe rely on the dough being held around 24 deg C, which is warmer than room temperature. You can simply wait longer, if you want. But if you want to vaguely follow the timings as written you need to keep the dough slightly warm so it ferments faster. You can do this by running your oven for just a couple of minutes, then turning it off and putting the dough in.
* “Dutch oven” is American-speak for “a big cast-iron casserole pot with a lid.” If you have a casserole pot that isn’t cast iron, you may need to lower the baking temperature a bit or risk destroying it (for example I have an aluminium one that is only supposed to be used up to 200 deg C.) See something to bake in below.
* The Perfect Loaf also has a beginner’s sourdough recipe that looks good, but is more complex than the no-knead one.

# Sourdough sandwich loaf by homemadefoodjunkie

https://www.homemadefoodjunkie.com/soft-sourdough-sandwich-bread-recipe/

A bit of a different style this, with a softer texture and much more delicate crumb; a nice change from the more artisan sourdough style recipes in this doc. Notes on the recipe:

* 50% scaling makes a 1 kg / 2 lb loaf. You probably need a loaf pan, or at least something the same sort of shape.
* The honey was hard to incorporate into the dough. I think you could or should just use plain white sugar.
* I used olive oil, I think any oil would work.
* Rather than work the salt directly into the dough, maybe hold back a little (30 ml or so) of the water, dissolve the salt in that, then work that into the dough after the first hour. It’s easier to make sure it’s evenly distributed that way.
* The last rise takes a long time, at least at room temperature. I had the dough shaped and in the loaf pan at 10:30, it was still quite a long way from being risen at 13:15. In the end I put it in a slightly warm (35 deg C) oven for an hour, which made it finish rising.
* Oil the tin very well, also oil the plastic you cover the loaf with while it’s rising in the tin, as it’ll stick otherwise.
The baking temperature is much lower than for sourdough boules - don’t be tempted to increase it or it’ll overcook (I did and it did.)

# Discard recipes

There’s also a variety of recipes out there that use the discard, ie. the gloopy bits of starter you throw away before feeding. Some ones I’ve used and liked:
Sourdough crumpets by King Arthur Flour - like with pancakes, there’s some slightly tricky trade-off between crumpet thickness, cooking temperature, and ring mold size. Be prepared for the first few you make to be testers while you get that figured out. Recipe is pretty good though.
Sourdough cheese crackers - I like these; some notes:
I made them with the recipe-specified amount of salt and a mild-ish cheddar. They were good, but a not punchy enough. Next time I’ll use mature cheddar and/or gruyere and sprinkle with flaked salt before baking. And I might increase the other seasonings too.
There wasn’t a lot of sour tang but that’ll depend a lot on how mature the starter is. It had been fed ~18 hours before and kept at room temperature. Might decrease the baking soda next time (it’s there to neutralise acids in the starter, I suspect.)
It’s tricky to roll out. It needs to be really thin. I rolled it on a piece of baking parchment then transferred the whole thing, parchment and all, to a baking tray.
I converted the recipe to non-bullshit units as I worked. Here you go:
210 g sourdough starter discard (100% hydration)
105 g plain flour (may need slightly more or less)
55 g butter
¼ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp mustard powder
¼ tsp salt
dash paprika
50 g cheese, shredded on a “fine” grade Microplane

Specialist equipment
Bakers love tools and jargon. They’re like computer programmers that way. Here’s the stuff I’ve accumulated:
Stand mixer
Real Bakers think you should knead by hand, but fuck that noise, it’s really hard work. Sourdough is extremely sticky. I’ve done almost all of my bread in a Kitchen Aid.

What to use instead: biceps and triceps. Or a no-knead method.
Dough scrapers
I use a soft rounded one like this for getting into bowl corners and a big flat one like this for moving dough around.

What to use instead: uhh, that’s a bit tricky. This is the one thing you might have to get.
Banneton / proofing basket
I use an 8” one like this to make ~1 kg loaves. I initially bought a 10”, but it’s a bit big (it’s awkward to fit in the fridge and it doesn’t fit inside any ziplock bags I could find.) I don’t use the lining cloth, I put the dough directly into the basket (heavily floured). This makes that pretty spiral pattern on the loaf after it’s cooked.

What to use instead: a mixing bowl lined with a clean towel dusted with plenty of flour.
Lame
A sharp blade used to score the dough just before baking. This allows it to rise properly. These blades don’t last long; they tend to get a bit rusty, probably from the dough’s moisture. I bought an excessively fancy one after using up the free one I got with my banneton.

What to use instead: your sharpest knife, or a naked clean razor blade (watch your fingers!)
Pots to keep the starter in
I like these round ones because they’re easier to stir (no corners for unmixed stuff to get stuck in.) And I like them to be as small as practical, because my fridge isn’t infinite, and I only make one loaf at a time so it’s not like I need lots of starter on hand. 700 ml is about right to me. When it’s in the fridge, you want an air-tight seal to stop it drying out. Also, they’re clear, so you can see the sides of the starter to see how bubbly it is.

What to use instead: any clean jar or plastic pots you have to hand.
A silicone spatula
Good for stirring the starter with. In particular, you can easily scrape down the sides of the pot you’re keeping the starter in, which means less dried-on starter gunk on the sides of the pot, which means easier cleaning. If you’re buying one, look for one where there’s no seams between handle and head, like this one. They’re easier to clean (dough can’t get stuck in cracks if there are no cracks.)

What to use instead: a spoon ;)
Kitchen scales
Look, don’t use cups, volumetric measurements are hopeless for baking. You need a scale. It’s the least optional element on this list.
Something to bake in
Professional bread ovens have really good seals and steam injection. This means they get nice and damp inside, which is important to get a good crust.

Domestic ovens are not good at this. Home bakers have a lot of hacks to get around this. The one I like is to bake bread inside a large pot. This will basically form a tiny oven, tight around the bread, which can get nice and steamy inside.

A cast iron casserole pot / Dutch oven is ideal. I used an aluminium one for a while, but then I realised it was only rated for 200 deg C so I was probably destroying it with the high temperatures you need for bread. Eventually I buckled and bought a Lodge combo cooker, which is really good for bread because you can use it upside down (shallow bit on the bottom) and not burn your knuckles on the pot when getting dough in and out.

Note that that Lodge cooker is really expensive in the UK (£80, compared to ~$60 in the US.) If you have any ability to pick it up in the ‘States, think about doing so (note it is very heavy though...)
Water spritz bottle
This kind of deal. Spritzing the dough with a fine mist of water just as it goes into the oven helps the crust develop. It’s not a big deal if you don’t have a suitable bottle though.

Ingredients
Flour
The most important thing is consistency. Flour can vary by a surprising amount, so if you change it you might find you need to adjust recipes to match the new flour (which all but guarantees a sub-par loaf or two.) 

I try to use only strong Canadian bread flour (I get the Waitrose own-brand stuff from Ocado). Wheats grown in North America have a higher protein content so develop more gluten when kneaded. All times and hydration levels below assume this; if you use British flour, they’ll need tweaking.

I also use a little wholemeal and rye flour in my normal recipe, for flavour. If you leave those out, you should adjust the water a little -- in theory it’ll want a little more, I think. I haven’t tried that yet. Let me know if you do!
Water
I just use cold water from the tap. There’s some fanciness some places do involving tweaking the water temperature but I’m not that extra yet. Also, I once read one site which advocated leaving the water out overnight to let the trace amounts of chlorine come out of it, so they don’t inhibit yeast growth. I suspect this is madness.
Salt
I use ordinary plain-ol’ table salt.

Making a starter
I just followed the advice in the appendix to create my starter. It’s just flour + water + time (and maybe a little bit of luck.) If you live in London or know me, please feel free to ask me for some of my starter, it’s no problem at all.
Looking after the starter
I think a lot of writers over-mystify this process.

What I do: keep it in the fridge in a pot with a good seal (I use these). Feed it every 7-10 days (I think it could go longer but I’ve never wanted to push my luck.) Otherwise, ignore it. If it’s living out of the fridge, I feed it every day, and I leave the lid loose so CO2 can escape.
Feeding it
Get the pot out of the fridge. Sniff it. Yeast smells are OK, alcohol smells are OK, gone-off smells are not so good (but not fatal I believe -- it’s not happened to me yet.) You can pour off the alcoholic liquid (“hooch”) on top, or mix it back in; it doesn’t seem to matter much.

Discard “most” of the starter. I don’t measure this, I just eyeball it. I tend to keep 25-50% of what’s in the pot, depending on how full it is, but you can be more aggressive (I saw someone who said they only keep a few tablespoons.) Add back in a 50/50 mix of flour and water, again, with the exact amount depending on how full the pot is. I tend to do 40-75 g of flour plus the same of water. Give it a good stir. Put the lid back on and put it back in the fridge. Done.

Oh, it’s slightly easier if you add the water to the starter first, and stir that until it’s dissolved. Then add the fresh flour. Silicone spatulas are good for this -- you can scrape down the sides of the pot and keep it clean-ish.

Making an overnight loaf for the weekend
Again: all timings etc below are just me “this is what works for me right now” take. But I’m still a novice. Also obviously you don’t have to bake on Saturdays, that’s just when I like to do it (so I have a loaf for the weekend.)
Thursday night: feed starter, remove from fridge
I initially skipped this step and that turned out to be a mistake. A lot of writers will insist that when you make the dough, the starter is at “peak growth” ie. recently fed and bubbling like mad. When I put some effort into doing that, I suddenly found my bread got better. I think it’s about consistency as much as anything: if you always have the starter in the same “place” when you knead, you can raise it the same way and get the same results.

So: Thursday night, either 
Take the starter out of the fridge and feed it as usual and leave it out (loosely covered) ~OR~
Take some of the starter out of the fridge, put the rest back, then feed the stuff you removed

This first feed won’t get it all that lively as it’s just come out of the fridge. So next, I feed it again.
Friday lunchtime: feed starter again
Yes, lunchtime. This is a pain in the arse if you have gainful employment (and is why I sometimes work from home on Fridays.)

The goal is, by the time you come to make the dough, you want it bubbling like crazy. That’s gonna take about six hours from when you give it this second feed (depending on your kitchen temperature). Which is awkward timing.

I think you could do this right before leaving for work in the morning or immediately after coming home, then tweak the next steps.

Note - don’t fill the container more than two-thirds full, unless you like mopping up after it escapes...

Friday evening: make dough
My technique here is a little different from the Bread Ahead recipe I started with (see the Appendix.) It has a “stiff starter” made ahead of time instead. This didn’t seem to do anything than make it more complicated.

I do this around 7-8pm.

Into the mixer’s bowl:





For a big-gish 1 kg loaf (just barely fits in an 8” proving basket):

400 g Canadian bread flour
50 g rye flour
50 g whole wheat flour
180 g bubbly starter
365 g water
measure out but don’t add yet: 12 g salt

For a small-ish 800 g loaf (fits nicely in an 8” basket):

300 g Canadian bread flour
38 g rye flour
38 g whole wheat flour
140 g starter
275 g water
measure out but don’t add yet: 9 g salt

Give the mixer a minute on low speed just to combine these (you can use the dough hook, you don’t need to dirty a different mixer attachment). Put the salt somewhere nearby as a visual reminder that you haven’t added salt yet (trust me, it’s easy to forget.)

Now let it sit for 30-60 minutes. This is the autolyse (more on this here.) The dough will absorb the water and start to form gluten, and the starter will start to feast on the fresh flour. This’ll make the dough come together much easier when you knead it.

Now add the salt and do the kneading. I then give it 6-8 minutes on middling speed (specifically, setting 4 on a 250 W Kitchen Aid.) How do you tell when it’s done? Uhh, I’m not so good at this bit. I do know it’s easy to under-work the dough (which will fail to develop enough gluten, and in turn will lead to flat, brick-like loaves) and tough to over-work it (which over-hardens the gluten and… leads to flat, brick-like loaves. Yes, I know.) So if in doubt, err on the side of caution. I think this is why bread books tell you to knead by hand...

You can also do a windowpane test.

Normally, I expect to see the dough ball up into a cohesive mass after a couple of minutes, clearing the sides and then the bottom of the bowl. Then around eight minutes, I find it starts to lose cohesion again, and stick to the bottom. That’s when I turn mine off. But I’m super fuzzy on this bit.



Bulk ferment
Get a clean bowl and put a little oil into it (vegetable, sunflower, groundnut -- something tasteless.) Scrape the dough out into it. Give it a few folds like in this video. Cover it to stop the dough drying out.

Leave it for approximately four hours, folding it hourly. Why “approximately”? Because it depends on room temperature and the temperature of the dough after you finished kneading it. You’re looking for the dough to feel right, by passing the bloop test.

If I’m short on time here, or if my kitchen is particularly cold, I’ll often rest it briefly in a warm oven to speed this along. Click the oven on for a minute or two, just enough to put a little warmth into the chamber. Turn it off, then put the dough in it. 

A lot of my early loaves were bad because I didn’t give this step enough time.
Shape
This’ll happen around 11pm or so, depending on when you started. See the Bread Ahead book below, I don’t do anything fancy here.

Once shaped, I put the loaf into a very well-floured banneton, with the seam/scruffy side up. If you’re using a bowl with a towel, make sure it has tons of flour on it. Then I put the banneton into a (big) zip-lock bag and put the whole thing into the fridge. The bag helps keep moisture in; without it, the outer surface of the dough will go dry, and it’ll stick to the banneton.
Saturday morning: time to bread
It should be nicely risen -- passing the bloop test and slightly puffy looking.

Get the oven ready: put in your baking pot in and preheat to very hot (I do 275 deg C but all ovens are different) for quite a while (I do about half an hour.) Leave the dough in the fridge while this happens.

Cut a bit of parchment paper to roughly the size of the banneton. Put it on top of the dough, put something big and flat on top of that (a baking sheet or a pizza peel or a big plate), and invert the whole lot. Pull the banneton gently upwards and the dough should release. You should now have your soon-to-be-a-loaf sitting on a piece of paper.

Get your lame and slash the dough -- there’s a million ways to do this but a simple cross is a good way to start. There’s a surprising amount of technique here: I think the most important thing is to cut decisively and quickly, and to have a really, really sharp blade. Lots of vids on YouTube. Spritz the dough with water from the spray bottle (this extra bit of moisture will help the crust.)

Get your (bloody hot) pot out of the oven. Put the dough into it, carefully -- either bring it over on the plate/baking sheet/whatever and slide it off, or use the paper as a sort of sling. 
Bake
Lid on the pot, into the oven. Then on my oven I do:
20 minutes at 240 deg C on “bread baking mode” (runs the top/bottom elements but doesn’t use the fan)
Then I take the lid off and reduce to 200 deg C (and leave the lid off)
Then I bake for a further 20-25 minutes, until it “looks done”

If you leave the lid on longer, you’ll get a thicker/chewier crust. Take it off sooner, you’ll get a thinner crust. Leave the loaf in longer overall, you’ll get a darker / more singed crust.
Cool
Yeah it’s hard work, but you have to let it cool. If you cut it too soon, you let loads of moisture out and it’ll go stale really fast. It sucks. Just breath in the glorious smell.

Making a loaf in one day - compressed schedule
The above process uses an overnight fermentation, which (they say) gives better flavour (it’s not massively different though in my experience.) If time is shorter, you can get it done in a few hours end-to-end. I’ve had success with the following modified dough:
375 g Canadian bread flour
50 g rye
50 g wholemeal
236 g 100% starter [20% inoculation]
12 g salt [2%]
340 g water [77%]
Note that this is a higher “inoculation” (ie. ratio of active starter to fresh flour/water) than I normally use. This helps speed things along.

I initially proofed this in a just-warm oven for a couple of hours. I used my oven’s dough setting at 35 deg C. You can replicate this by turning the oven on briefly (with it empty!), then turning it off, then putting the dough in. If you get it too hot it’ll kill the yeast so be careful. If you have a thermometer, don’t go above 40 deg C. Don’t forget to fold the dough every 30 minutes or so.

After proofing, I shaped it, put it in the banneton, and put that back into the oven (again at 35 deg C) for another ~1.5 hours. Use the bloop test (see above) to judge when it’s done.

All in, I started mixing the dough at 9am and had bread by 2pm.

Cleaning up tips
Never let dough dry on anything; it turns to concrete. This includes your sink after you rinse bowls and utensils out - have a good look to make sure no dough has spattered anywhere.
Any tool/bowl/etc that’s dirty, throw it in the sink and fill it with hot water. Leave it to soak, pour the water out, wipe out big lumps of dough with a tissue. Then put it in the dishwasher or wash it.
Discarded starter can be disposed of down the sink, but make sure it’s dissolved in and well diluted with hot water. Putting it in the bin can make a bit of a stink.
After shaping, your work surface will be covered in flour and scraps of dough. Grab your bowl and your dough scraper and scrape any loose stuff off the edge of the counter and into the bowl. Then get a damp cloth and go over it to pick up the loose flour. It should be clean now. If it’s really covered in very sticky remnants, you can sprinkle down lots of flour first -- it’ll de-sticky the dough.
Similarly, if your hands are covered in sticky dough, vigorously rub a generous amount of flour over them and it should come off more easily.
Don’t let the banneton get damp; any scraps of dough will go mouldy, and they’re a pain to clean. Leave it out to dry thoroughly. Similarly, the bag you put the banneton in can be reused; turn it inside out and let it dry off.
Don’t dishwasher silicone spatulas; they tend to absorb nasty soap smells.

Appendix: the Bread Ahead cookbook
This was the book I started with, and most of the stuff above is still based on it. I don’t think there’s anything particularly special about it -- it’s not the book I’d suggest you buy, if you were buying one -- but it was the one I had. (The book I usually see most often recommended is Flour Water Salt Yeast by Ken Forkish. I don’t have it yet.)

I’ve included all the relevant pages from the Bread Ahead book for the basic sourdough loaf below:
