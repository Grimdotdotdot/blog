Last year, I bought a house. Subsequently, I [bought rather a lot of Hue devices](xxx). When I [mentioned a while back on Twitter](xxx) about this newfound and arguably out-of-control smartbulb addiction, some friends expressed mild opinions that amounted roughly to _have you lost your damned mind?!_ Wounded, I now turn to this blog post as an attempt to justify this to myself, and also to you.

The truth is that although it's unfashionable non-cynical, I've found the Hue system to be well-considered, well-designed, and genuinely useful. It's even won over my wife, who has much less patience than I for the vagaries of technology. Here are some of the things that won us over and some things we learned along the way.

## Hue bulbs are often on sale

Never pay full price unless you're in a hurry. Most of my bulbs and other Hue devices were picked up either in 3-for-2 sales on the Hue website or deeply discounted starter packs on Amazon on the like, that pop up several times a year in the usual sale promotions.

These can work out quite reasonably priced. Most of the cost of my system was around 30 GU10 bulbs that I needed for my kitchen and throughout all the stairs and hallways. The old install had halogen GU10s, which were suffering from overheating so had to be replaced. The Hue bulbs were approximately Â£12 each xxxCHECK after the discounts, which isn't cheap, but was not a great deal more than an equivalent long-life dumb LED GU10.

## Full colour doesn't matter (much)...

Just about every early smartbulb ad featured smiling people bathed in lurid multicoloured lights. Most people I've talked to about smartbulbs have a "who the hell wants that" reaction to this. And they're right! I have a small number of full RGB lights and the multicolour effect is almost entirely novelty. Don't pay the (high) premium for RGB lights unless you're sure you want them. They can work for specific applications: I sometimes set an accent colour on the TV's bias light, for example, and we have some spotlights in our lounge that we use for colour accents. 

But mostly, RGB is frippery. Don't be deterred by the high price of RGB bulbs, or think you'll be missing out if you get the cheaper ones.

## ...but 'tuneable white' does

However, having said that, I must now point out there is a happy middle ground between the excess of full RGB and the Spartan purity of white-only bulbs. There isn't a very good name for these; some manufacturers call them 'tuneable white', Philips call them 'Ambience'. They're bulbs with an adjustable white balance; they can be changed from a brighter, colder, bluish white, to a neutral white, to a dimmer, warmer, orangey white.

These things are great. _Great._

The ability for most of the lights in our house to adjust not just their brightness but also their white balance to suit time of day is extremely useful. In the morning, I have my bedside lamp set to a bright, cool white to help me wake me up. In the evening, our lounge lights are set to a program that is dimmer, and shifted to a more relaxing yellowish shade. 

## Wireless light switches can go anywhere

This was the single most important factor in our decision to go all-in on Hue. Our new house has a slightly weird layout, with some rooms at the back built on a separate foundation as the whole house is on a slope. This means in turn that the stairs between levels go up for ten or so steps, turn through 180 degrees on a landing, then go up a few more. None of which would matter except the electrician that wired it up appeared to be uncapable of deciding where that made the logical places for hallway lightswitches to go. We have one set of stairs that only has one at the bottom; we have another that has two switches at either end of the short run of three steps, barely ten feet apart.

You can move normal lightswitches, of course. But it involves digging out a section of plaster to run the new conduit, getting an electrician to make the hookups, dealing with any unpleasant surprises from the existing wiring, and then plastering and painting again to make good the damage. This isn't cheap. In fact, it's sufficiently expensive to make mid-range smart bulbs look cheap by comparison.

And smart bulbs, of course, can be controlled by wireless switches, which you can place anywhere. The legacy in-wall switches are ignorable.

## More tricks with remote switches

You can do more than move switches from one end of the stairs to another, though. A set of lights can be controlled from more than one switch. I have a button on the first floor landing that turns off the living room, kitchen, and garden lights in one press; it's the "I'm going to bed now" button. 

There's a shed at the bottom of our garden which has two exterior lights in it. When we moved in, the only way to turn these lights on or off was to unlock the shed first, which was hassle and likely to lead to leaving the shed unlocked when the lights were on. With smartbulbs in the fittings, however, they can be switched on and off from the house as required.

## Smartphone apps good, but physical switches better...

Speaking of switches: switches are more important than I first realised. Even if you're smartphone-addicted, so always have it, and even if you put a control app for your smartbulbs onto your home screen or smartwatch, there's still a surprising amount of friction to getting your phone out simply to turn the lights on. Compare this to flicking a switch on the wall, which you've probably been doing your whole life and now feels completely automatic. It gets tiresome.

I started with a small number of switches to see how we got on, thinking we'd mostly use smartphone apps or voice control via a smart speaker. But it quickly became apparent to me that the switches were much more convenient, so I added more until it stopped feeling annoying. I'm certainly happier using switches for most interaction with the smart bulb system, only using the app for more complex settings eg. selecting colour palettes for xxx

## ...timers can be useful...

## ...but automatic lights are the best of all

What's more sci-fi than having the room lights flick on as you walk in? Well, lots of things, including spaceships and androids. But we don't have those things so it's just the lights for now.

Hue sell a little sensor gadget that combines a light level sensor, a motion sensor, and a temperature sensor. The first two unlock programmability like "when you sense motion between the hours of X and Y and the light level is dimmer than A, switch the lights on for M minutes."

I have these rigged up to all our corridors, our kitchen, and our garden lights. xxx
